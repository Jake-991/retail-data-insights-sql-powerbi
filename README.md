## 📌 Project Objective

To help business stakeholders make informed decisions by analyzing:
- Which products drive the most revenue and profit
- Which stores are underperforming or inefficient
- How returns and inventory affect business operations
- What time-based patterns affect sales trends

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used

- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** – Joins, CTEs, aggregation, CASE logic
- **Power BI** – Dashboards, KPI cards, DAX measures, visual design
- **DAX** – Custom measures for profit, return rate, revenue per square foot
- **Excel** – Preload data review
- **Data Modeling** – Schema design and table relationships

## 🧾 Example SQL Logic

This project was SQL-driven. Here's an example query to flag underperforming stores based on revenue:

```sql
WITH store_revenue AS (
  SELECT store_id,
         SUM(quantity * unit_price * (1 - discount)) AS total_revenue
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY store_id
)
SELECT store_id,
       CASE 
           WHEN total_revenue < (SELECT AVG(total_revenue) * 0.7 FROM store_revenue)
           THEN 'Underperforming'
           ELSE 'Normal'
       END AS status
FROM store_revenue;
```

## 🗃️ Data Sources

This project uses five synthetic CSV datasets:
- `sales.csv` – Transaction-level records
- `products.csv` – Product cost and category info
- `stores.csv` – Store size, region, open date
- `inventory.csv` – Stock levels and restock dates
- `returns.csv` – Quantity and reasons for product returns

## 🧠 Key Business Questions

### 📦 Product Performance
- What are the top-selling and most profitable products?
- Which products have high return rates (potential quality issues)?
- Which products underperform in both revenue and volume?

### 🏬 Store Performance
- Which stores generate the most revenue?
- Are any stores underperforming based on revenue vs. average?
- Which stores have high return rates or low stock levels?

### 📅 Time Trend Analysis
- How does revenue fluctuate over time?
- Which months drive the most sales?
- Are weekends stronger than weekdays?

---

## 🔄 ETL & Modeling Approach

- Imported all CSVs into SQL and used joins/CTEs to perform calculations.
- Modeled clean, joined tables in Power BI using relationships on `product_id` and `store_id`.
- Created dynamic DAX measures for profit, return rate, average stock, and revenue efficiency.
- Used conditional formatting and card visuals to highlight business risks and opportunities.
